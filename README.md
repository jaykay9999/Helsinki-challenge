# Helsinki-challenge
Requirements libraies:
  -numpy
  -Keras
  -OpenCv
  -Matplotlib
  -random
 
 
 When you run the main file, the program will try to find the best kernel weights and bias to deblur that specific image compared to a random non blurry image using the genetic algorithm. 
 
 after some run time, the program should be able to find the best 13x13 kernel for that blurry image from the input folder path then use that filter on the blurry image and save it in the ouput folder.
 
 for this program :
 
 the population size = 10
 
 mutation rate = 0.01
 
 and it will run for 5 generations.
 
 
 these values can be changed for better outputs but we believe that these are the best for such large images.
